Code used in the analysis for the publication "Effects of surface and top wind shear on the spatial organization of marine Stratocumulus-topped boundary layers", M. Zamora Z., T. Heus, J. Kleissl, to be submitted to JAMES.

Post-processing UCLA-LES runs for setup of Sc clouds with varied wind shear conditions. Focus on spatial detection of updrafts and downdrafts using a threshold vertical profile, and on the geometric characterization of the objects found.
